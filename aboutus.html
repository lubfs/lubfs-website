  <h1>About us</h1>
	  <p class="about-p">To enrich students with opportunities and knowledge within the Investment Banking and Finance industry, by sharing knowledge,
        networking and gaining a real insight from professionals.</p>
        <br>
    <p class="about-p">We are a society that share an interest in the financial world. Whether it ranges from Investment Banks, Hedge Funds, the Big
        Four or even, technology within those firms. We will give you the chance to experience what it’s like to work in the finance world and have the opportunity to
        possibly network with professionals from major firms such as, Barclays, KPMG and more. In addition, throughout the year, we look to give insights on what
        it’s like to work in an investment bank, hedge fund, private equity or a professional services firm, like JPMorgan, BlackRock or KPMG.
        For this year, we plan to have societal roles, whereby, we will hand out roles to what a member desire. The roles consist of Equity
        Research report group, Asset Management Group, M&A group and more.</p>

    <p class="about-p">Last year, our inter-collegiate trading simulations competition with Warwick University was a total success and we will continue to contact them to run
        the trading simulations. These trading simulations are where students get a feel on how Investment Banks and retail traders - buy or sell stocks,
        commodities or foreign exchange pairs. We also collaborated with Amplify Trading last February (Feb 2020)</p>
    <br>
    <p class="about-p">Furthermore, there will be technical analysis sessions on how to approach a stocks chart and to get a grasp of how technical
        analysts analyse the price of any asset. These sessions will help you in your trading simulation session and kick off your trading
        journey! Possibly, we may include some sessions on programming.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="about-p">On top of the technical side, there will be fundamental sessions on how to formulate a balance sheet, income statement and
        discounted cash flow.</p>
    <p class="about-pFREE">*Membership for 2020/2021 year is FREE! All events will be ran online, via Zoom/Microsoft Teams, due to the guide lines.</p>
